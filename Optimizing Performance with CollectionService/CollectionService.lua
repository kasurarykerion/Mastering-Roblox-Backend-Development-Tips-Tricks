Tip #5: Use CollectionService to dynamically manage large numbers of objects in your game. It's faster and more efficient than manual management. Here's how!

local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")

-- Tag parts in Studio or via the script
CollectionService:AddTag(part, "Interactable")

-- Access all tagged part !
local taggedParts = CollectionService:GetTagged("Interactable")
for _, part in pairs(taggedParts) do
    part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
        print("Player touched the part named " .. part.Name)
    end)
end

âš¡ Leverage tags to group objects dynamically. Ideal for games with procedurally generated content.
